						<p><strong>Dylan Forbes</strong> is the ideal puzzler. Once a puzzle is placed before him, it has little time left until it is solved optimally. Outside of perfecting solving techniques, Dylan enjoys juggling and Jake and Amir. Every year, Dylan attends the Puzzlers United conference to catch up on all the latest puzzles that must be solved.</p>

						<p><strong>Isaac Garfinkle</strong> is the Postmaster General of the United States. In his free time, he masquerades as a college student who is an avid swing dancer and comedian. With all of this on his plate, Isaac still manages to seek out mail far and wide, in rain, sleet, and snow, to deliver it to the recipient clearly marked (with 5 digit zip code) in black or blue ink on the package.</p>

						<p><strong>Reilly Hallstrom</strong>&mdash;the chief dreamer&mdash;breathes light upon all he touches. Not really, but he claims he does. Besides building beautiful homepages for comps websites, Reilly truly loves the outdoors. In particular he is an avid flyfisherman and spends every spring on the rivers of northern Lake Superior. Reilly views fishing as the ultimate puzzle between Oncorhynchus mykiss (scientific name for Rainbow trout) and man.   </p>

Her dreams include but are not limited to: getting a dog, learning how to grill, creating a sentient robot, and travelling to Italy. One of those will be happening relatively soon.  </p>
